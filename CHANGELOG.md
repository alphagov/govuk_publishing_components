# Changelog

- We use the [GOV.UK versioning guidelines](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/publishing-a-ruby-gem.html#versioning).
- Mark breaking changes with `BREAKING:`. Be sure to include instructions on how applications should be upgraded.
- Include a link to your pull request.
- Don't include changes that are purely internal. The CHANGELOG should be a
  useful summary for people upgrading their application, not a replication
  of the commit log.

### How to upgrade

Change instances like this:

```erb
<%= render 'govuk_publishing_components/components/govspeak', content:
"<p>Foo #{bar}</p>" %>
```

into the following safe version:

```erb
<%= render 'govuk_publishing_components/components/govspeak' do %>
  <p>Foo <%= bar %></p>
<% end %>
```

This will prevent XSS vulnerabilities where `bar` is user input.

* Extend the document list component (PR #355)
* Remove policies from the taxonomy navigation sidebar (PR #357)

## 9.0.1

* The component guide is no longer using `Slimmer::GovukComponents`, so this

```

The share links component has changed fundamentally, the PR to update it in [government-frontend is here](https://github.com/alphagov/government-frontend/pull/906) and it isn't used in any other app yet.

## 8.2.0

  component. If you're using this component you should remove any canonical
  tags, OpenGraph tags and Twitter cards (#335)

* Move the Next and previous component from static (PR #329)

* Add a Phase banner component to replace the Alpha/Beta banners in Static (PR #333)

### Upgrade instructions

Replace the Title and Lead paragraph by running the following:

```
find app/views -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i '' 's/govuk_component\/previous_and_next_navigation/govuk_publishing_components\/components\/previous_and_next_navigation/g'
find app/views -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i '' 's/govuk_component\/title/govuk_publishing_components\/components\/title/g'
find app/views -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i '' 's/govuk_component\/lead_paragraph/govuk_publishing_components\/components\/lead_paragraph/g'
find app/views -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i '' 's/govuk_component\/government_navigation/govuk_publishing_components\/components\/government_navigation/g'
```
