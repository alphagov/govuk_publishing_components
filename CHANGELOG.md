# Changelog

- We use the [GOV.UK versioning guidelines](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/publishing-a-ruby-gem.html#versioning).
- Mark breaking changes with `BREAKING:`. Be sure to include instructions on how applications should be upgraded.
- Include a link to your pull request.
- Don't include changes that are purely internal. The CHANGELOG should be a
  useful summary for people upgrading their application, not a replication
  of the commit log.

  You must make the following changes when you migrate to this release:
  - Check application's dependencies on deprecated projects (`govuk_frontend_toolkit`, `govuk_elements_rails` and `govuk_template`) and set [compatibility flags](https://govuk-frontend-review.herokuapp.com/docs/#settings/compatibility) appropriately before importing `govuk_publishing_components`. Note that all applications that rely on a layout from static depend indirectly on `govuk_template` and most frontend applications rely on `govuk_frontend_toolkit`. [Example commit](https://github.com/alphagov/calendars/commit/edd649e6c2c7732d4a2e44713dd9463feeaf990b)
  - Update [`govuk-colour` mixins](https://govuk-frontend-review.herokuapp.com/docs/#helpers/colour-function-govuk-colour) to support legacy colours. [Example commit](https://github.com/alphagov/calendars/commit/ccd2b25873ee026858958d4732d42071bea57255)

### How to upgrade

Change instances like this:

```erb
<%= render 'govuk_publishing_components/components/govspeak', content:
"<p>Foo #{bar}</p>" %>
```

into the following safe version:

```erb
<%= render 'govuk_publishing_components/components/govspeak' do %>
  <p>Foo <%= bar %></p>
<% end %>
```

This will prevent XSS vulnerabilities where `bar` is user input.

  gem can now be used with [Slimmer 13.0.0][s13] ([PR #353](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_publishing_components/pull/353))

[s13]: https://github.com/alphagov/slimmer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1300

```

The share links component has changed fundamentally, the PR to update it in [government-frontend is here](https://github.com/alphagov/government-frontend/pull/906) and it isn't used in any other app yet.

## 8.2.0

* Add better meta tags for third parties to the "Machine readable metadata"

### Upgrade instructions

Replace the Title and Lead paragraph by running the following:

```
find app/views -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i '' 's/govuk_component\/previous_and_next_navigation/govuk_publishing_components\/components\/previous_and_next_navigation/g'
find app/views -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i '' 's/govuk_component\/title/govuk_publishing_components\/components\/title/g'
find app/views -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i '' 's/govuk_component\/lead_paragraph/govuk_publishing_components\/components\/lead_paragraph/g'
find app/views -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i '' 's/govuk_component\/government_navigation/govuk_publishing_components\/components\/government_navigation/g'
```

BREAKING: breaking release, should be easy to migrate.

Previously with aXe we excluded all warnings relating to duplicate ids, this release allows you to exclude any rules you'd like to but removes this default.
Any components that relied on this default will need this rule adding to their documentation file.

See [test/.../docs/test-component-with-duplicate-ids.yml](spec/dummy/app/views/components/docs/test-component-with-duplicate-ids.yml) for an example of how this looks. ([PR #101](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_publishing_components/pull/101))
