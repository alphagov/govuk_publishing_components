jasmine-browser-runner runs your Jasmine specs in a browser. It's suitable for
interactive use with normal browsers as well as running specs in CI builds
using either headless browsers or with a remote Selenuium grid provider
such as Saucelabs.

# Getting started

```bash
npm install --save-dev jasmine-browser-runner jasmine-core
npx jasmine-browser-runner init
```

or

```bash
yarn add -D jasmine-browser-runner jasmine-core
npx jasmine-browser-runner init
```

If you intend to use ES modules, add `--esm` to the `jasmine-browser-runner init`
command.

Then, customize `spec/support/jasmine-browser.mjs` to suit your needs. You can
change the spec files, helpers, and source files that are loaded, specify the
[Jasmine env's configuration](https://jasmine.github.io/api/edge/Configuration.html),
and more.

In addition to `spec/support/jasmine-browser.mjs`, jasmine-browser-runner also
supports other config file paths:

* `spec/support/jasmine-browser.js`
* `spec/support/jasmine-browser.json` (generated by previous versions of the 
  `init` subcommand)
* Any other JavaScript or JSON file, if you use the `--config` option. This 
  file can be a JSON file or a javascript file whose default export is a config
  object.

More information about the configuration can be found at the runner [documentation website](https://jasmine.github.io/api/browser-runner/edge/Configuration.html).

To start the server so that you can run the specs interactively (particularly
useful for debugging):

```
npx jasmine-browser-runner serve
```

To run the specs in a browser (defaults to Firefox):

```
npx jasmine-browser-runner runSpecs
```

To use a browser other than Firefox, add a `browser` field to 
`jasmine-browser.mjs`:

```javascript
export default {
  // ...
  "browser": "chrome"
}
```

Its value can be `"firefox"`, `"headlessFirefox"`, `"safari"`, 
`"MicrosoftEdge"`, `"chrome"`, or `"headlessChrome"`.

## TLS support

To serve tests over HTTPS instead of HTTP, supply a path to a TLS cert and key
in PEM format in `jasmine-browser.mjs`:

```javascript
export default {
  // ...
  "tlsKey": "/path/to/tlsKey.pem",
  "tlsCert": "/path/to/tlsCert.pem",
  // ...
}
```

These can also be specified on the command line with `--tlsKey` and `--tlsCert`.

Note that if you are using a self-signed or otherwise invalid certificate, the
browser will not allow the connection by default.  Additional browser configs
or command line options may be necessary to use an invalid TLS certificate.

## Controlling which network interfaces are listened to

By default, jasmine-browser-runner listens to all available network interfaces.
You might need that if you're using a remote grid such as Saucelabs. If you 
don't need that, you can improve security by listening only to localhost. 

```javascript
export default {
  // ...
  "listenAddress": "localhost",
  // ...
}
```

## Hostname support

If you need to access your tests via a specific hostname, you can do that by
setting the `hostname` configuration property:

```javascript
export default {
  // ...
  "hostname": "mymachine.mynetwork",
  // ...
}
```

This can also be specified on the command line with `--hostname`.

Setting `hostname` but not `listenAddress` has the same effect as setting
`listenAddress` to the same value as `hostname`. If you need to set a hostname
but retain the default behavior of listening to all network interfaces, you can
do that by setting `listenAddress` to `"*"`.

There are a few important caveats when doing this:

1. This name must either be an IP or a name that can really be resolved on your
   system. Otherwise, you will get `ENOTFOUND` errors.
2. This name must correspond to an IP assigned to one of the network interfaces
   on your system. Otherwise, you will get `EADDRNOTAVAIL` errors.
3. If this name matches the [HSTS preload list](https://hstspreload.org/),
   browsers will force the connection to HTTPS.  If you are not using TLS, you
   will get an error that says `The browser tried to speak HTTPS to an HTTP
   server.  Misconfiguration is likely.`  You may be surprised by the names on
   that preload list, which include such favorite local network hostnames as:
    - dev
    - foo
    - app
    - nexus
    - windows
    - office
    - dad
  You can see a full list in [Chromium source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chromium/chromium/main/net/http/transport_security_state_static.json)
  or query your hostname at the [HSTS preload site](https://hstspreload.org/).


## ES module support

If a source, spec, or helper file's name ends in `.mjs`, it will be loaded as
an ES module rather than a regular script. Note that ES modules can only be
loaded from other ES modules. So if your source files are ES modules, your
spec files need to be ES modules too. Want to use a different extension than
`.esm`? Just set the `esmFilenameExtension` config property, e.g.
`"esmFilenameExtension": ".js"`.

To allow spec files to import source files via relative paths, set the `specDir`
config field to something that's high enough up to include both spec and source
files, and set `srcFiles` to `[]`. You can autogenerate such a configuration by
running `npx jasmine-browser-runner init --esm`.

If you have specs or helper files that use top-level await, set the
`enableTopLevelAwait` config property is set to `true`.

[Import maps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap)
are also supported:

```javascript
export default {
   // ...
   "importMap": {
     "moduleRootDir": "node_modules", 
     "imports": {
       "some-lib":"some-lib/dist/index.mjs",
       "some-lib/": "some-lib/dist/",
       "some-cdn-lib": "https://example.com/some-cdn-lib"
      }
   }
}
```

## Use with Rails

You can use jasmine-browser-runner to test your Rails application's JavaScript,
whether you use the Asset Pipeline or Webpacker.

### Webpacker

1. Run `yarn add --dev jasmine-browser-runner jasmine-core`.
2. Run `npx jasmine-browser-runner init`.
3. Edit `spec/support/jasmine-browser.mjs` as follows:
```
export default {
  "srcDir": ".",
  "srcFiles": [],
  "specDir": "public/packs/js",
  "specFiles": [
    "specs-*.js"
  ],
  "helpers": [],
  // ...
}
```
4. Create `app/javascript/packs/specs.js` (or `app/javascript/packs/specs.jsx`
   if you use JSX) as follows:
```
(function() {
  'use strict';

  function requireAll(context) {
    context.keys().forEach(context);
  }

  requireAll(require.context('spec/javascript/helpers/', true, /\.js/));
  requireAll(require.context('spec/javascript/', true, /[sS]pec\.js/));
})();
```
5. Add `'spec/javascript'` to the `additional_paths` array in `config/webpacker.yml`.
6. Put your spec files in `spec/javascript`.

To run the specs:

1. Run `bin/webpack --watch`.
2. Run `npx jasmine-browser-runner`.
3. visit <http://localhost:8888>.

### Asset Pipeline

1. Run `yarn init` if there isn't already `package.json` file in the root of
   the Rails application.
2. Run `yarn add --dev jasmine-browser-runner`.
3. Run `npx jasmine-browser-runner init`.
5. Edit `spec/support/jasmine-browser.mjs` as follows:
```
export default {
  "srcDir": "public/assets",
  "srcFiles": [
    "application-*.js"
  ],
  "specDir": "spec/javascript",
  "specFiles": [
    "**/*[sS]pec.?(m)js"
  ],
  "helpers": [
    "helpers/**/*.?(m)js"
  ],
  // ...
}
```
6. Put your spec files in `spec/javascript`.

To run the specs:

1. Either run `bundle exec rake assets:precompile` or start the Rails 
   application in an environment that's configured to precompile assets.
2. Run `npx jasmine-browser-runner`.
3. Visit <http://localhost:8888>.

## Remote Grid support (Saucelabs, BrowserStack, etc.)

jasmine-browser-runner can run your Jasmine specs on a remote grid
provider like [Saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com/), 
[BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com) or your own Selenium Grid.
To use a remote grid hub, set the `browser` object
in your config file as follows:

```javascript
// jasmine-browser.mjs
export default {
  // ...
  // BrowserStack
  "browser": {
    "name": "safari",
    "useRemoteSeleniumGrid": true,
    "remoteSeleniumGrid": {
      "url": "https://hub-cloud.browserstack.com/wd/hub",
      "bstack:options": {
        "browserVersion": "16",
        "os": "OS X",
        "osVersion": "Monterey",
        "local": "true",
        "localIdentifier": "tunnel ID",
        "debug": "true",
        "userName": "your BrowserStack username",
        "accessKey": "your BrowserStack access key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```javascript
// jasmine-browser.mjs
export default {
  // ...
  // Saucelabs
  "browser": {
    "name": "safari",
    "useRemoteSeleniumGrid": true,
    "remoteSeleniumGrid": {
      "url": "https://ondemand.saucelabs.com/wd/hub",
      "platformName": "macOS 12",
      "sauce:options": {
        "tunnel-identifier": "tunnel ID",
        "userName": "your Saucelabs username",
        "accessKey": "your Saucelabs access key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When using a remote grid provider, all properties of the `browser` object are
optional except for `name` which will be passed as the `browserName` capability,
and `useRemoteSeleniumGrid` which must be set to a value of `true`. if a
`remoteSeleniumGrid` object is included, any values it contains, with the
exception of the `url` will be used as `capabilties` sent to the grid hub url.
if no value is specified for the `url` then a default of
`http://localhost:4445/wd/hub` is used. 

It's common for remote grids to support only a limited set of ports. Check your
remote grid's documentation to make sure that the port you're using is 
supported. When using a remote grid, `jasmine-browser-runner` will run on port 
5555 unless you use the `--port` command line option or specify a port in the
second parameter to`startServer`.

## Want more control?

```javascript
// ESM
import path from 'path';
import jasmineBrowser from 'jasmine-browser-runner';
import config from './spec/support/jasmine-browser.mjs';

config.projectBaseDir = path.resolve('some/path');
jasmineBrowser.startServer(config, { port: 4321 });


// CommonJS
const path = require('path');
const jasmineBrowser = require('jasmine-browser-runner');

import('./spec/support/jasmine-browser.mjs')
  .then(function({default: config}) {
    config.projectBaseDir = path.resolve('some/path');
    jasmineBrowser.startServer(config, { port: 4321 });
  });
```

## Supported environments

jasmine-browser-runner tests itself across popular browsers (Safari, Chrome, 
Firefox, and Microsoft Edge) as well as Node.

| Environment       | Supported versions     |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Node              | 18, 20                 |
| Safari            | 15-17                  |
| Chrome            | Evergreen              |
| Firefox           | Evergreen, 102, 115    |
| Edge              | Evergreen              |

For evergreen browsers, each version of jasmine-browser-runner is tested against
the version of the browser that is available to us at the time of release. Other 
browsers, as well as older & newer versions of some supported browsers, are
likely to work. However, jasmine-browser-runner isn't tested against them and 
they aren't actively supported.
