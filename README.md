# GOV.UK Publishing Components!!!!!!!

This gem:

- Provides shared components for applications
- Provides helpers to generate component payloads
- Provides an application to preview components

Components should be added to this gem if they are required in more than one application, otherwise they should be added to that application.

There are 2 types of helper classes in this app:

- [AppHelpers](lib/govuk_publishing_components/app_helpers). Are exposed to the applications using this gem. They should be documented using RDoc.
- [Component Presenters](lib/govuk_publishing_components/presenters). Anything in these classes is only for use within the components. They should be marked `@private`.

## GOV.UK Frontend

This gem is the way GOV.UK consumes [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend), part of the GOV.UK Design System.

We use NPM to pull in the GOV.UK Frontend styles and Javascript, but we don't commit
the `node_modules` directory. To install GOV.UK Frontend on your machine, run:

```
npm install
```

You'll need to have installed Node and NPM for this.

## Documentation

[See the rubydoc.info documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/govuk_publishing_components)

Run the documentation locally with:

```
bundle exec yard server --reload
```

## Running tests

The default rake task runs all tests:

```
bundle exec rake
```

Javascript is tested using Jasmine and the [Jasmine gem](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine-gem). Tests can be run either in the browser or on the command line via the dummy appâ€™s tasks:

```sh
# browser
bundle exec rake app:jasmine

# command line
bundle exec rake app:jasmine:ci
```
