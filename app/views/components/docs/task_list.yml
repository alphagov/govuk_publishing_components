name: Task list
description: Numbered groups containing expanding/collapsing steps
body: |
  Task lists are designed to show a sequence of steps towards a specific goal, such as 'learning to drive'. Each group of a task list can contain one or more steps. Each step can contain one or more links to pages. User research suggested that each step should be collapsed by default so that users are not overwhelmed with information.

  If JavaScript is disabled the task list expands fully. All of the task list functionality (including the icons and aria attributes) are added using JavaScript.

  The task list is based on the accordion component in collections, but has been altered. This is for two reasons.

  - task lists are needed throughout GOV.UK and extending the accordion to be the task list would require promoting it to static, which would break integration testing
  - creating a new component allows further iteration without impacting the accordion
accessibility_criteria: |
  The task list must:

  - indicate to users that each step can be expanded and collapsed
  - inform the user when a step has been expanded or collapsed
  - be usable with a keyboard
  - allow users to show or hide all steps at once
  - inform the user which step a link belongs to
  - inform the user which step the current page is in, particularly where there are multiple steps in one group
  - be readable when only the text of the page is zoomed - achieved for the numbers and logic elements by their text being wrapped in several elements that give them a white background and ensure the text when zoomed expands to the left, not to the right, where it would obscure the step titles

  The show/hide all button only needs to list the first panel id in the aria-controls attribute, rather than all of them.

  Step headings must use a button element:

  - so that steps can be toggled with the space and enter keys
  - so that steps can't be opened in a new tab or window

  When JavaScript is unavailable the task list must:

  - be fully expanded
  - not be marked as expandable

  remember_last_opened_step:

      If a step is opened its ID is appended to the end of the URL, so that if the URL is shared or the 'back' button is used, that step will be opened on page load. This was historically part of the behaviour of the accordion. By default this is turned off and cannot be used together with the option to open a step by default.

      This behaviour is used with the 'links to more information' option.

  with_links:
    description: |
      Links can have the following attributes:

      - style, an attribute on the parent list that controls its appearance, either required (bold), optional (not bold) or choice (not bold, with bullets on the list). The default is optional.
      - context, an optional text field to show some extra information after the link, usually a monetary value
      - active, whether to make the link highlighted (to indicate the current page)
      - highlight_group, a general option to highlight a specific group of steps. Usually the active link would be in the active group, but in some circumstances there might be an active group but no highlighted link.

    description: |
      If a page is in a task list more than once and a user is viewing that URL, both links to it will be highlighted as the site has no way to know which entry in the task list the user is currently viewing (highlighted links should only occur when the task list is in the sidebar).

      JavaScript is included in the component to solve this. It uses sessionStorage to capture the data-position attribute of non-external links in the task list when clicked, and then uses this value to decide which link to highlight when the new page loads. This session storage data is immediately deleted after it is read on page load, mainly to prevent problems with highlighting if the user were to move between different task lists.

      If a user has not clicked a link (i.e. has visited the page without first clicking on a task list) the first active link in the first active group will be highlighted. If there is no active group, the first active link will be highlighted (but there should always be an active group).

      The current page in the task list is an anchor link to the top of the page. If there are more than one of these and the user clicks one that is not currently highlighted, that one will be highlighted.

      The example below will show all links highlighted if JS is disabled, in the real world no more than two or three links are likely to be highlighted at once.

      Steps can be optional. This is controlled by two parameters for maximum flexibility, 'optional' (which causes the step to have a dotted line down the side) and 'logic', which defaults to showing the word 'and' alongside the step title, but also accepts 'or'.

      If a step is optional this should be conveyed by the text within that step.
