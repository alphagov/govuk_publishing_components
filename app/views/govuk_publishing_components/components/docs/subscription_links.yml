    data:
      email_signup_link: '/foreign-travel-advice/singapore/email-signup'
      feed_link: '/foreign-travel-advice/singapore.atom'
  with_margin:
    description: The component accepts a number for margin bottom from `0` to `9` (`0px` to `60px`) using the [GOV.UK Frontend spacing scale](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/spacing/#the-responsive-spacing-scale). It defaults to having no margin bottom, although some margin is supplied by the links themselves (so that when they stack on mobile there is space between them).
    data:
      email_signup_link: '/foreign-travel-advice/singapore/email-signup'
      feed_link: '/foreign-travel-advice/singapore.atom'
      margin_bottom: 9

      email_signup_link_text: 'Get notifications'

      feed_link_text: 'View feed'
  with_copyable_feed_link:
    description: |
      This option changes the feed link to a toggle control, which opens a hidden element containing an input prepopulated with the value passed to the component, usually a URL to an atom feed. This uses the [form input](/component-guide/input) component.

      Note that this option overrides the feed_link option, so if both are passed feed_link is ignored. Note that a value for email_signup_link can also be passed as normal.
    data:
      email_signup_link: '/foreign-travel-advice/singapore/email-signup'

      By default the component includes an h2 heading. The component could be used anywhere on the page and could mean that it produces invalid markup or make the site unaccessible.
    data:
      email_signup_link: '/foreign-travel-advice/singapore/email-signup'
      feed_link: '/foreign-travel-advice/singapore.atom'
      hide_heading: true

      email_signup_link_text: 'Recevez des notifications'
      email_signup_link_text_locale: 'fr'
      feed_link: '/foreign-travel-advice/singapore.atom'
      feed_link_text: 'Flux RSS'
      feed_link_text_locale: 'fr'

      The component is used on translated pages that don't have a translation for the text strings. This means that it could display the fallback English string if the translate method can't find an appropriate translation. This makes sure that the `lang` can be set to ensure that browsers understand which parts of the page are in each language.

      The `lang` attribute **must** be set to a [valid BCP47 string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang#Language_tag_syntax). A valid code can be the two or three letter language code - for example, English is `en` or `eng`, Korean is `ko` or `kor` - but if in doubt please check.
