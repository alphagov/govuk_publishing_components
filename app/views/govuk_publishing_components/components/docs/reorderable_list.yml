name: Reorderable list
description: A list of items that can be reordered
body: |
  List items can be reordered by drag and drop or by using the up/down buttons.
  On small viewports the drag and drop feature is disabled to prevent being triggered
  when scrolling on touch devices.

  This component uses SortableJS - a JavaScript library for drag and drop interactions.
  When JavaScript is disabled a set of inputs will be shown allowing users to provide
  an order index for each item.

  When this component is embedded into a form and that form is submit you will receive a
  parameter of `ordering` (which can be customised with the `input_name` option).
  This will contain item ids and ordering positions in a hash.

  For example, for two items with id "a" and "b" that are ordered accordingly,
  you'd receive a submission of `ordering[a]=1&ordering[b]=2`, which Rails can
  translate to `"ordering" => { "a" => "1", "b" => "2" }`.
