      alt: An image of the lords chamber
      caption: The Lords Chamber on the 14th of August. A large number of people are in attendance, filling the seats in the lower and upper areas. Several people are wearing hats.
  figure_with_caption_and_svg:
    description: SVGs should behave like normal images, but will have a caption wider than the SVG if the SVG does not fill the available width (see following example for explanation).

      caption: The Lords Chamber on the 14th of August. A large number of people are in attendance, filling the seats in the lower and upper areas. Several people are wearing hats.
  figure_with_caption_and_bad_svg:
    description: This example shows an SVG containing a base64 encoded PNG image, instead of correct SVG elements. This was taken from a live GOV.UK page. We use the CSS `has` selector to ensure the containing figure has a width of 100%, otherwise it collapses to zero, making the image invisible. We can't distinguish between these kinds of SVGs, so all SVGs will have a full width caption as a consequence (see previous example).
