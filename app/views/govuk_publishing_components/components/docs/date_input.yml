name: Form date input
description: Use the date input component to help users enter a memorable date or one they can easily look up.
accessibility_criteria: |
  Inputs in the component must:

  * accept focus
  * be focusable with a keyboard
  * be usable with a keyboard
  * be usable with touch
  * indicate when they have focus
  * be recognisable as form input elements
  * have correctly associated labels
  * be of the appropriate type for their use, in this case 'number'

  Labels use the [label component](/component-guide/label).

  Avoid using [`autofocus`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autofocus) and `tabindex` unless you have user research to support this behaviour.

      Settting a name at the component level helps generating the name for each individual input within the
      component as follows: `custom-name[day]`, `custom-name[month]`, `custom-name[year]`
    data:
      name: "dob"
  with_autocomplete_for_date_of_birth_fields:
    description: |
      Use the `autocomplete_date_of_birth` option when you're asking for the user's date of birth. This supports browsers or tools that can autofill the information on a user's behalf if they've entered it previously.

      Note that the option should only be passed to the component if the date of birth asked for is the date of birth of the person filling the form in and not asked for on behalf of someone else.
