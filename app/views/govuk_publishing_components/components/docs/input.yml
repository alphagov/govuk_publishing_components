name: Form input
description: A form input field and an associated label.
accessibility_criteria: |
  Inputs in the component must:

  * accept focus
  * be focusable with a keyboard
  * be usable with a keyboard
  * be usable with touch
  * indicate when they have focus
  * be recognisable as form input elements
  * have correctly associated labels
  * be of the appropriate type for their use, e.g. password inputs should be of type 'password'

  Labels use the [label component](/component-guide/label).

  Avoid using `autofocus` and `tabindex` unless you have user research to support this behaviour.
govuk_frontend_components:
  - text-input
examples:
  default:
    data:
      label:
        text: "What is your name?"
      name: "name"
  specific_input_type:
    description: By default the input will be `type="text"`. This parameter accepts an alternative, e.g. `search` or `email`. `spellcheck="false"` is the default this can be changed by passing a `true` value. Consider adding `autocomplete`. No validation is done on this input.
    data:
      label:
        text: "What is your email address?"
      name: "address"
      type: "email"
  with_autocomplete:
    data:
      label:
        text: "Automatically complete the field with a user's email address (in supporting browsers)"
      name: "name"
      type: "email"
      autocomplete: "email"
  numeric_input:
    description: If input is set to `type="number"` we set the component up as described in the [GOV.UK Design System guidance](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/text-input/#numbers) adding `inputmode` and `pattern`. These values can be overridden if necessary.
    data:
      label:
        text: "Account number"
      name: "account-number"
      type: "number"
  with_an_identifier:
    description: Give the input a specific `ID`.
    data:
      label:
        text: "Has an id"
      name: "hasid"
      id: "hasid"
  with_aria_attributes:
    description: |
      The component accepts two possible aria attributes: `aria-describedby` and `aria-controls`.

      [`aria-describedby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-describedby_attribute) is used to indicate the `ID` of the element that describes the input. This will be overridden in the event of an error, where the error will be used for the `describedby` attribute value. This example uses the `ID` of the main container for demonstration purposes as there aren't any useful elements with `IDs` in the component guide. In real use this would be passed the `ID` of an element that correctly described the input.

      `aria-controls` allows the addition of an `aria-controls` attribute, for use in places like the finders where the page is updated dynamically after value changes to the input.
