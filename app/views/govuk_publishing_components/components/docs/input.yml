name: Form input
description: A form input field and an associated label.
accessibility_criteria: |
  Inputs in the component must:

  * accept focus
  * be focusable with a keyboard
  * be usable with a keyboard
  * be usable with touch
  * indicate when they have focus
  * be recognisable as form input elements
  * have correctly associated labels
  * be of the appropriate type for their use, e.g. password inputs should be of type 'password'

  Labels use the [label component](/component-guide/label).

  Avoid using autofocus and tabindex unless you have user research to support this behaviour.

examples:
  default:
    data:
      label:
        text: "What is your name?"
      name: "name"
  specific_input_type:
    description: By default the input will be type="text". This parameter accepts an alternative, e.g. "search" or "email". No validation is done on this input.
    data:
      label:
        text: "What is your email address?"
      name: "address"
      type: "email"
  numeric_input:
    description: If input is set to `type="number"` we set the component up as described in the [Design System guidance](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/text-input/#numbers) adding `inputmode` and `pattern`. These values can be overridden if necessary.
    data:
      label:
        text: "Account number"
      name: "account-number"
      type: "number"
  with_an_identifier:
    description: Give the input a specific ID.
    data:
      label:
        text: "Has an id"
      name: "hasid"
      id: "hasid"
  with_aria_attributes:
    description: |
      The component accepts two possible aria attributes: aria-describedby and aria-controls.

      [aria-describedby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-describedby_attribute) is used to indicate the ID of the element that describes the input. This will be overridden in the event of an error, where the error will be used for the describedby attribute value. This example uses the ID of the main container for demonstration purposes as there aren't any useful elements with IDs in the component guide. In real use this would be passed the ID of an element that correctly described the input.

      aria-controls allows the addition of an aria-controls attribute, for use in places like the finders where the page is updated dynamically after value changes to the input.
