  There are three types of events that would lead GOV.UK to add an emergency banner to the top of each page on the web site; a notable death, a national emergency or a local emergency.

  See the [opsmanual](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/emergency-publishing.html#adding-emergency-publishing-banners) for information about what the Emergency Banner is and when it should be deployed.
