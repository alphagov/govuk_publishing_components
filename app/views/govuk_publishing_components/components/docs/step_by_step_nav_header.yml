name: Step by step navigation header
description: Shows that a content page is part of a step by step navigation
body: |
  The component indicates to the user that the current page is part of a [step by step navigation](/component-guide/step_by_step_nav), and can provide a link to it.
accessibility_criteria: |
  The component is designed to go into the top of an existing content page. This component looks like a heading so uses a heading level 2 element.

  An earlier version of the component did not use a heading element &ndash; this failed WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.3.1 ("Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.")

  An early version of the component contained a hidden skip link for keyboard and screen reader users, that jumped to the step by step navigation component in the sidebar (similar to the 'skip to content' link at the top of all GOV.UK pages). User testing suggested that rather than helping users it confused them, so this has been removed.

  Always place the step by step navigation header at the top of a page, before the `<main>` element. Placing the component here means that the "Skip to main content" link allows the user to skip all navigation links, including the step by step navigation header.

      The component accepts a number for margin bottom from `0` to `9` (`0px` to `60px`) using the [GOV.UK Frontend spacing scale](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/spacing/#the-responsive-spacing-scale). It defaults to having a margin bottom of `30px`.
