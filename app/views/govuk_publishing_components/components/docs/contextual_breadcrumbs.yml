  preview with real data, see the [contextual navigation preview][preview].

  There are 4 main variants of the component:

  - Step by step, which uses the [step by step header][header]
  - Parent breadcrumb, which uses the `parent` link of the page with the [breadcrumbs component][breadcrumbs]
  - Taxon breadcrumb, which uses the `taxons` link of the page with the [breadcrumbs component][breadcrumbs]
  - Organisation breadcrumb, which uses the `organisations` link of the page with the [breadcrumbs component][breadcrumbs]

  It must always used [together with the contextual sidebar][sidebar] and [footer].
