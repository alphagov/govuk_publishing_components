accessibility_criteria: |
  Text and links in the Footer must:

  - have a text contrast ratio higher than 4.5:1 against the background colour to meet [WCAG AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast)

  Images in the Footer must:

  - be presentational when linked to from accompanying text "Open Government Licence (OGL) icon".

  Landmarks and Roles in the Footer should:

  - avoid navigation landmarks or roles

    The footer element alone is sufficient for such cases; while a [`nav` element](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sections.html#the-nav-element) can be used, it is usually unnecessary.

    Note: This decision has been made based on prior experience seeing removal of overuse of `<nav>` elements from www.GOV.UK, which made it confusing for users of assistive technologies to know what were the most important navigation aspects of GOV.UK.
    Should be challenged if user research indicates this is an issue.
