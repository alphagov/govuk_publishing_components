name: "Breadcrumbs"
description: "Navigational breadcrumbs, showing page hierarchy"
body: |
  Accepts an array of breadcrumb objects. Each crumb must have a title and a URL.

  We recommend that if using the breadcrumbs for navigation purposes, you set `collapse_on_mobile` to `true` to make things more readable for mobile users. However, you can specify `collapse_on_mobile:``false` or remove the flag completely to stop this behaviour.

accessibility_criteria: |
  The breadcrumb links must have a text contrast ratio higher than 4.5:1 against the background colour to meet WCAG AA
  (this especially applies when [using the inverse flag](/component-guide/breadcrumbs/inverse)).

  Always place breadcrumbs at the top of a page, before the `<main>` element. Placing them here means that the "Skip to main content" link allows the user to skip all navigation links, including breadcrumbs.
