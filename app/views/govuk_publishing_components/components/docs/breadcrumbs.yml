name: "Breadcrumbs"
description: "Navigational breadcrumbs, showing page hierarchy"
body: |
  Accepts an array of breadcrumb objects. Each crumb must have a title and a URL.
  Links have tracking data but links to the homepage (any link with a url of `/`) will be tracked separately as `homeLinkClicked`.

  We recommend that if using the breadcrumbs for navigation purposes, you set `collapse_on_mobile` to `true` to make things more readable for mobile users. However, you can specify `collapse_on_mobile:``false` or remove the flag completely to stop this behaviour.
shared_accessibility_criteria:
  - link

  (this especially applies when [using the inverse flag](/component-guide/breadcrumbs/inverse)).
