name: Pagination
description: Navigational links that allow users to navigate within a series of pages
  or elements.
body: |
  This component accepts 3 optional parameters: previous, next and items.

  The next and previous parameters accept:

  - an URL for the link
  - a title for the URL
  - a label that can add extra info (ie page number) that will be displayed under the title

  If one of the 2 parameters is nil, no link will appear.

  The item parameter accepts an array of objects with the following parameters:

  - an href for the link
  - a number of the page (required if ellipsis not set)
  - current, if set then the item will be styled as the current page
  - ellipsis, if set then the item will not be a link but will be a seperator with the text of "..."
  - visually hidden text, which will override the default aria label of the page link (Page NUMBER)

  For more guidance on best practice, please refer to the [GOV.UK Design System's Pagination guidance](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/pagination/).
