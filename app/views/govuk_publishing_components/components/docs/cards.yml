name: Cards (experimental)
description: A grid of cards that have a link and a description
body: |
  The component renders the cards as an unordered list element and visually presents it as a grid. It doesn't use the [GOV.UK Design System grid](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/layout/#grid-system) but sets its own so that it can separately target desktop, tablet and mobile columns.

  You can display the grid in three or two columns on desktop. Browsers that don't support CSS grid always display one column.

  You must set a `href` for all the links.

  This component is currently experimental. If you are using it, please feed back any research findings to the GOV.UK Explore team.
accessibility_criteria: |
  The component must:

  -  use the correct heading level hierarchy eg. if the component heading uses a `<h2>`, the subheadings must use a `<h3>`

  It is also good practise to include a heading above the list to tell users what the list contains
