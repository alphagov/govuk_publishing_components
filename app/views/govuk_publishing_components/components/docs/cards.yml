name: Cards (experimental)
description: A grid of cards that have a link and a description
body: |
  The component renders the cards as an unordered list element and visually presents it as a grid. It doesn't use the [GOV.UK Design System grid](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/layout/#grid-system) but sets its own so that it can separately target desktop, tablet and mobile columns.

  You can display the grid in three or two columns on desktop.

  You must set a `href` for all the links.

  This component is currently experimental. If you are using it, please feed back any research findings to the GOV.UK Explore team.
