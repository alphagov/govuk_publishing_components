name: Intervention
description: An area that contains personalised content to the user
body: |
  The intervention is used to show personalised content. For instance, if the user has visited multiple
  pages in the same area of the site, we might want let them know that there are other pages on GOV.UK
  that would be useful to them. This component would be used to add this personalised content and would
  indicate to the user that this is not normally part of the page, but has been added for them specifically.

  The dismiss link works without Javascript by pointing to the current URL with the "hide-intervention"
  query string parameter set to "true". It's progressively enhanced and sets a cookie to remember that
  the user has dismissed the banner before. The cookie requires a "name" parameter, the value of which
  is stored in the cookie to distinguish which campaign banner the user has dismissed.

      Note: "(opens in a new tab)" is added to link text if the phrase isn't included.
