name: Intervention
description: An area that contains personalised content to the user
body: |
  The intervention is used to show personalised content. For instance, if the user has visited multiple
  pages in the same area of the site, we might want let them know that there are other pages on GOV.UK
  that would be useful to them. This component would be used to add this personalised content and would
  indicate to the user that this is not normally part of the page, but has been added for them specifically.

  The dismiss link points to the current URL with the "hide-intervention" query string parameter set to "true". The backend should check for this string in order to render the same page without the intervention.

accessibility_criteria: |
  The intervention component must:

  - have a border colour contrast ratio of more than 4.5:1 with its background to be visually distinct
  - prevent screen readers from announcing the dismiss link icon


shared_accessibility_criteria:
  - link
examples:
  default:
    data:
      suggestion_text: "You should renew your permit every 6 months."

  with_suggestion_link:
    data:
      suggestion_text: "Based on your browsing you might be interested in"
      suggestion_link_text: "Travel abroad: step by step"
      suggestion_link_url: "/travel-abroad"

  with_dismiss_link:
    data:
      suggestion_text: "You should renew your permit every 6 months."
      dismiss_text: "Hide this suggestion"

  with_suggestion_link_only:
    data:
      suggestion_link_text: "You can now apply for a permit online."
      suggestion_link_url: "/permit"

  with_hide:
    description: |
      This example is for when we want to hide by default and display to the user based on some logic,
      either in the backend or with Javascript.
    data:
      suggestion_link_text: "You may be invited to fill in a questionnaire"
      suggestion_link_url: "/questionnaire"
      hide: true

  open_suggestion_link_in_new_tab:
    description: |
      When sending users to another online task, you don't want to completely hijack
      their original flow on GOV.UK. Adding the option to open links in a new tab helps to address this.
      Link text should tell the user that the link opens in a new tab.
      Note: "(opens in a new tab)" is added to link text if the phrase isn't included.
    data:
      suggestion_link_text: "You can now apply for a permit online"
      suggestion_link_url: "www.google.com/permit"
      new_tab: true

  with_data_attributes:
    description: |
      This example shows the use of `suggestion_data_attributes` and
      `dismiss_data_attributes` for click tracking.

      Other data attributes can also be applied as required. Note that the component does not include built in tracking. If this is required consider using the [track click script](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_publishing_components/blob/main/docs/analytics/track-click.md).
    data:
      suggestion_text: "Based on your browsing you might be interested in"
      suggestion_link_text: "Travel abroad: step by step"
      suggestion_link_url: "/travel-abroad"
      suggestion_data_attributes:
        track-category: "interventionBanner"
        track-action: "interventionClicked"
        track-dimension: "Travel abroad: step by step"
        track-dimension-index: "29"
        track-label: "clicked suggestion"
      dismiss_text: "Hide this suggestion"
      dismiss_data_attributes:
        track-category: "interventionBanner"
        track-action: "interventionDismissed"
        track-dimension: "Hide this suggestion"
        track-dimension-index: "29"
        track-label: "hide the intervention"
