      Data attributes can be applied to the summary element of the component.

      This can be used for tracking as shown. Custom JavaScript in the component fires tracking events when the details element is opened and closed. By default, `track-label` is set to the status (`open` or `closed`) unless a `track_label` is passed into the component.
