name: Inverse header
description: A wrapper to contain header content in white text
body: |
  This component can be passed a block of template code and will wrap it in a blue header. This is as light-touch as possible and doesn't attempt to deal with the margins and paddings of its content, neither does it enforce the white text it requires. Implemented to accomodate topic and list page headings and breadcrumbs but unopinionated about its contents.

accessibility_criteria: |
  The component must:

  * be used in conjunction with content that renders a text contrast ratio higher than 4.5:1
  against the header colour to meet WCAG AA.

examples:
  default:
    data:
      block: |
        <div class="pub-c-title pub-c-title--inverse">
          <h1 class="pub-c-title__text ">
            Education, Training and Skills
          </h1>
        </div>
  for_full_page_width:
    description: "Used when the header covers the full width of the page, but it's content is in the grid layout. The left-right padding is removed to make the contents line up with the other items on the page."
    data:
      full_width: true
      block: |
        <div class="pub-c-title pub-c-title--inverse">
