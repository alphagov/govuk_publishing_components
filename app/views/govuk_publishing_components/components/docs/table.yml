accessibility_criteria: |
  Accessible tables need HTML markup that indicates header cells and data cells and defines their relationship. Assistive technologies use this information to provide context to users.
  Header cells must be marked up with `<th>`, and data cells with `<td>` to make tables accessible.
  For more complex tables, explicit associations is needed using scope attributes.

  with_sortable_head:
    description: |
      This option allows links to be added to the table headers for sorting. Sorting must be handled server side, it is not done by the component.

      The example shown applies a tracking attribute specifically for use by Google Tag Manager in [Content Publisher](https://github.com/alphagov/content-publisher).

      Other data attributes can also be applied as required. Note that the component does not include built in tracking. If this is required consider using the [GA4 link tracker](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_publishing_components/blob/main/docs/analytics-ga4/trackers/ga4-link-tracker.md).
