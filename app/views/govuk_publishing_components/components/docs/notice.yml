name: Notice
description: A notice to convey and highlight information
body: |
  The notice component replaces the notice and withdrawal notice patterns on GOV.UK.

  The component accepts either a simple string description_text parameter that it wraps in a paragraph, or a description_govspeak parameter that is rendered through govspeak for more complex HTML layout.
accessibility_criteria: |
  The notice must:

  - have a border colour contrast ratio of more than 4.5:1 with its background to be visually distinct.
  - always render headings with associated description content, so there are no isolated heading elements inside the component
