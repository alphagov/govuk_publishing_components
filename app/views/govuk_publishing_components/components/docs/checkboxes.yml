govuk_frontend_components:
  - checkboxes
accessibility_criteria: |
  The component must:

  - accept focus
  - be focusable with a keyboard
  - be usable with a keyboard
  - be usable with touch
  - indicate when they have focus
  - have correctly associated labels
  - have a legend (see below)

  Labels use the [label component](/component-guide/label).

  Checkboxes in a fieldset require a legend. The text of the legend is passed using the 'heading' option. If no heading is passed, no legend is shown, which causes an accessibility error. You must pass a heading when using this component, or provide other measures to ensure accessibility.
examples:
  default:
    data:
      name: "favourite_colour_default"
      items:
        - label: "Red"
          value: "red_colour"
  with_multiple_checkboxes:
    description: When more than one checkbox is shown they are wrapped in a fieldset element, which requires a legend. This must be supplied to the component using the heading option.
    data:
      name: "favourite_colour"
      heading: "What is your favourite colour?"
      items:
        - label: "Red"
          value: "red"
        - label: "Green"
          value: "green"
        - label: "Blue"
          value: "blue"
  with_a_custom_id_attribute:
    description: Note that if an id is not given one is generated automatically. In either case, the id is applied to the parent element of the checkboxes, and each checkbox is given the same id with an incremented number at the end, e.g. the checkboxes below have ids of potatoes-0 and potatoes-1.
    data:
      name: "potatoes"
      id: "potatoes"
      heading: "What kind of potatoes do you like?"
      items:
        - label: "Red"
          value: "red"
        - label: "Green"
          value: "green"
  with_custom_hint_text:
    description: Note that a hint (and a heading) is only displayed if there is more than one checkbox.
    data:
      name: "favourite_skittle"
      heading: "What is your favourite skittle?"
      hint_text: "Taste the rainbow"
      items:
        - label: "Red"
          value: "red"
        - label: "Green"
          value: "green"
        - label: "Blue"
          value: "blue"
  with_legend_as_page_heading:
    description: Since the legend/heading is required, if the checkboxes are alone on a page it makes sense to use this element as the H1 on the page rather than duplicate text.
    data:
      name: "favourite_colour"
      heading: "What is your favourite colour?"
      is_page_heading: true
      items:
        - label: "Red"
          value: "red"
        - label: "Green"
          value: "green"
        - label: "Blue"
          value: "blue"
  checkboxes_with_data_attributes:
    description: Data attributes such as tracking can be applied if required. Note that for a checkbox this will not fire tracking events automatically, so if you want your tracking to work you'll need to write some tracking Javascript in the app around the component to detect it.
    data:
      name: "With tracking"
      items:
        - label: "Tracked"
          value: "tracked"
          data_attributes: {
            track_category: "checkboxClicked",
            track_label: "/news-and-communications",
            track_action: "news",
            track_options: {
              dimension28: 2,
              dimension29: "Tracked"
            }
          }
  with_aria_controls_attributes:
    description: Aria controls attributes are applied to the checkboxes only if Javascript is enabled.
    data:
      name: "aria_controls"
      heading: "What areas are you interested in?"
      items:
        - label: "Farming and the environment"
          value: "farming"
          controls: "js-live-results"
        - label: "Water recycling"
          value: "water"
          controls: "js-live-results"
  checkboxes_with_individual_hints:
    data:
      name: "nationality"
      heading: "What is your nationality?"
      hint_text: "If you have dual nationality, select all options that are relevant to you."
      items:
        - label: "British"
          value: "british"
          hint: "including English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish"
        - label: "Irish"
          value: "irish"
        - label: "Other"
          value: "other"
          hint: "anything other than the above"
  checkbox_items_with_error:
    data:
      name: "nationality"
      heading: "What is your nationality?"
      error: "Select if you are British, Irish or a citizen of a different country"
      hint_text: "If you have dual nationality, select all options that are relevant to you."
      items:
        - label: "British"
          value: "british"
          hint: "including English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish"
        - label: "Irish"
          value: "irish"
        - label: "Other"
          value: "other"
  checkbox_items_with_conditional_reveal:
    description: |
      Checkboxes can be configured to show additional elements when checked. This could include further components, such as text inputs as shown.

      Note that if you do insert HTML, this may cause accessibility violations if the additional elements have different name attributes to the checkboxes. No styling will be applied to the inserted content by the component.
    data:
      name: "contactingme"
      id: "contactingme"
      heading: "How would you like to be contacted?"
      hint_text: "Please select all options that are relevant to you."
