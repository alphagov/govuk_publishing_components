name: Form checkboxes
description: Let users select one or more options with checkboxes.
body: |
  If there is more than one checkbox they are rendered in a list. If there is only one, the markup is simplified to a single div and a heading attribute is not required. A `[]` needs to be appended to the name for Rails to treat the checkbox value as an array, otherwise only the last selected item is captured.
govuk_frontend_components:
  - checkboxes
accessibility_criteria: |
  The component must:

  - accept focus
  - be focusable with a keyboard
  - be usable with a keyboard
  - be usable with touch
  - indicate when they have focus
  - have correctly associated labels

  Labels use the [label component](/component-guide/label).

        - label: Red
          value: red_colour
  with_multiple_checkboxes:
    description: When more than one checkbox is shown they are wrapped in a fieldset element, which requires a legend. This must be supplied to the component using the heading option.
    data:
      name: favourite_colour[]
      heading: What is your favourite colour?
      items:
        - label: Red

          value: tiny
        - label: Little
          value: little
  with_a_heading_on_one_checkbox:
    description: One checkbox does not require a fieldset and therefore does not require a legend. However, if a heading is supplied, a fieldset will be included in the component and the heading used as the legend, as shown.
    data:
      name: agree
      heading: Please tick the box to agree
      items:
        - label: I agree
          value: agree
  with_custom_hint_text:
    description: Hint text defaults to 'Select all that apply' but can be overridden with this option. Note that a hint (and a heading) is only displayed if there is more than one checkbox.

      heading: What is your favourite skittle?

          value: green
        - label: Blue
          value: blue
  with_description_text:
    description: |
      If a description text is added, it is displayed under the legend but before the hint text.
      The description text can only render text and not govspeak specific syntax.
      This is a pattern that is used across GOV.UK where a question is followed by a description.
    data:
      name: favourite_skittle[]
      heading: Choose your favourite skittles
      description: |
        Skittles consist of hard sugar shells imprinted with the letter "S".

          value: blue
  with_description_text_and_header:
    description: |
      If a description text is added with a page heading, it is displayed under the heading but before the hint text.
      The description text can only render text and not govspeak specific syntax.

  with_page_header_and_caption:
    description: |
      If a caption text is provided with a page heading, it will be displayed above the heading.
      A caption can only be used with a page heading. If a heading is not provided the caption will not render.
      The pattern is used across GOV.UK to show a high-level section that this page question falls into.

      heading: Choose your favourite skittles
      heading_caption: Question 3 of 9

      no_hint_text: true

  with_a_hidden_heading:
    description: If the heading/legend on the checkboxes is not required, it can be visually hidden using this option. It will still be visible to screen readers.
    data:
      name: favourite_colour[]
      heading: What is your favourite colour?

          value: green
        - label: Blue
          value: blue
  with_a_custom_id_attribute:
    description: Note that if an `id` is not given one is generated automatically. In either case, the `id` is applied to the parent element of the checkboxes, and each checkbox is given the same `id` with an incremented number at the end, e.g. the checkboxes below have ids of `potatoes-0` and `potatoes-1`.
    data:
      name: potatoes[]
      id: potatoes
      heading: What kind of potatoes do you like?
      items:

          id: custom-orange-id
        - label: Purple
          value: purple
  with_legend_as_page_heading:
    description: Since the legend/heading is required, if the checkboxes are alone on a page it makes sense to use this element as the H1 on the page rather than duplicate text.

      heading: What is your favourite colour?
      is_page_heading: true
      items:

  with_custom_heading_size:
    description: |
      This allows the size of the legend to be changed. Valid options are `s`, `m`, `l`, `xl`, defaulting to m if no option is passed.

      If the `is_page_heading` option is `true` and `heading_size` is not set, the text size will be `xl`.
    data:
      name: favourite_colour[]
      heading: What is your favourite colour?

  checkbox_with_exclusive_item:
    description: |
      Allows an option to become exclusive, as follows:

        - when the exclusive item is checked, all non-exclusive items are unchecked
        - when a non-exclusive item is checked, the exclusive item is unchecked

      This behaviour should be doubled by similar checks on the backend.

  checkbox_items_with_conditional_reveal:
    description: |
      Checkboxes can be configured to show additional elements when checked. This could include further components, such as text inputs as shown.

      Note that if you do insert HTML, this may cause accessibility violations if the additional elements have different name attributes to the checkboxes. No styling will be applied to the inserted content by the component.
