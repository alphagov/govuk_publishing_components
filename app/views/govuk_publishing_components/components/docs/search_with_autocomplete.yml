name: Search with autocomplete (experimental)
description: |
  A version of the search component enhanced with the ability to fetch and display search
  suggestions from a remote source as a user types.
body: |
  This component uses [Accessible Autocomplete](https://github.com/alphagov/accessible-autocomplete)
  to enhance the [`search` component's](/component-guide/search) input element.
  If the user does not have JavaScript enabled, the search component will function as normal.

  The Accessible Autocomplete component generates its own input field (rather than working on the
  existing one). We then remove the old input field from the DOM, and enhance the component to:

    * give it the correct attributes and classes from the original input field
    * fetch suggestions from a remote URL as the user types
    * highlight parts of suggestions where they match the user's input
    * submit the form the component is contained in when a suggestion is selected

  The component will fetch results from the provided `source_url`, which should always return a JSON
  response with a single object at the root, which has a property `source_key` containing an array
  of strings. The component will then display these strings as suggestions to the user.

  Note that the inline label on the `search` component conflicts with the markup and styling
  generated internally by Accessible Autocomplete. Our current designs do not foresee us using
  autocomplete on a search box with an inline label, and this component will always force the
  `inline_label` option on its nested `search` component to be `false`.

  Note that this component has undergone a DAC audit in September 2024, but should be considered
  experimental until it has been AB tested on GOV.UK.
