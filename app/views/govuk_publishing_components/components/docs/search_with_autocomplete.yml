name: Search with autocomplete (experimental)
description: |
  A version of the search component enhanced with the ability to fetch search suggestions from a
  remote source as a user types.
body: |
  This component uses [Accessible Autocomplete](https://github.com/alphagov/accessible-autocomplete)
  to enhance the [`search` component's](/component-guide/search) input element.
  If the user does not have JavaScript enabled, the search component will function as normal.

  Note that the inline label on the `search` component conflicts with the markup and styling
  generated internally by Accessible Autocomplete. Our current designs do not foresee us using
  autocomplete on a search box with an inline label, and this component will always force the
  `inline_label` option on its nested `search` component to be `false`.
