description: The chart component presents a data chart and a tabular version of the same data
part_of_admin_layout: true
body: |
  This component takes a set of data and presents it as a line graph and a table with one or more rows and lines.
  The chart relies upon chartkick and renders using JavaScript, so the table is provided as a fallback for a lack of JavaScript,
  an accessible view on the data for screenreaders, and a simple view of the raw data for all users.

  The `chart_overview` option can be used to provide an explanation for screen reader users of what the graph shows.

  minimal_version:
    description: |
      The minimal version presents a simplified version of the chart. This should only be used where there is not enough space to display a full chart, and the user is then given an option to see more information about the chart, for example by including a link next to the chart component. This must be part of the page, as this is not provided by the component itself.

      Specifically, minimal mode:

      - hides the chart heading
      - removes the legend and X and Y axis values
      - removes the data table and link to the data (if supplied) beneath the chart
      - removes the part of the visually hidden accessibility message that links to the table
      - removes the ability to interact with the chart (no hover popups or clicks)
      - sets the size of the points on the chart to zero
