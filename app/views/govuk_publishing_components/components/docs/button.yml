name: Button
description: Use buttons to move though a transaction, aim to use only one button per page.
body: |
  Button text should be short and describe the action the button performs.

  This component is also [extended for use in govspeak](https://components.publishing.service.gov.uk/component-guide/govspeak/button).

  These instances of buttons are added by Content Designers, ideally this duplication would not exist but we currently don't have shared markup
  via our components within the generated [govspeak](https://github.com/alphagov/govspeak).
  (This is a challenge to the reader)

  - accept focus
  - be focusable with a keyboard

      inline_layout: true
  with_name_and_value_set:
    description: |
      By default, the button has no value or name set so it will not pass information when the form is submitted. This allows a name and value to be added so a button can add information to the form submission.

      Please note that Internet Explorer 6 and 7 have **breaking bugs** when submitting a form with multiple buttons - this can [change what value is submitted by the button](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#Notes). Make sure to check your user needs and browser usage.

      text: This is the button text

      name: this_is_the_name

      aria_describedby: with_aria_describedby
  with_form_attribute:
    description: |
      Buttons will usually be contained within their containing form, but sometimes it is desirable to have the button
      outside the form with the `form` attribute pointing to the ID of the form. See
      [The Mozilla dev docs on a button's `form` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#form)
      for more information.
