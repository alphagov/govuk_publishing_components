name: Button
description: Use buttons to move though a transaction, aim to use only one button per page.
body: |
  Button text should be short and describe the action the button performs.

  This component is also [extended for use in govspeak](https://components.publishing.service.gov.uk/component-guide/govspeak/button).

  These instances of buttons are added by Content Designers, ideally this duplication would not exist but we currently don't have shared markup
  via our components within the generated [govspeak](https://github.com/alphagov/govspeak).
  (This is a challenge to the reader)
