name: Button
description: Use buttons to move though a transaction, aim to use only one button per page.
body: |
  Button text should be short and describe the action the button performs.

  This component is also [extended for use in govspeak](https://govuk-static.herokuapp.com/component-guide/govspeak/button).

  This component uses styles from GOV.UK Frontend.

  These instances of buttons are added by Content Designers, ideally this duplication would not exist but we currently don't have shared markup
  via our components within the generated [govspeak](https://github.com/alphagov/govspeak).
  (This is a challenge to the reader)
