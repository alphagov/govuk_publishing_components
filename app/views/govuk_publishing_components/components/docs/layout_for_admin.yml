name: Admin layout (experimental)
description: A layout to be used by admin applications
body: |
  This component uses [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend),
  part of the GOV.UK Design System.

  It also includes the styles for the other components in this gem, so that you can use
  these components as well.

  This component is experimental. Breaking changes are likely and we'll not release
  major version of the gem for these changes.

  Because it is an entire layout, this component can only be [previewed on a separate page](/admin).

  Typically you'll use this together with:

  - the [layout header component](/component-guide/layout_header)
  - the [layout footer component](/component-guide/layout_footer)
  - the [layout main component](/component-guide/layout_main)
