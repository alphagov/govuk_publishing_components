name: Admin layout (experimental)
description: A layout to be used by admin applications
body: |
  This component uses [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend),
  part of the GOV.UK Design System.

  This component is experimental. Breaking changes are likely and we'll not release
  major version of the gem for these changes.

  Because it is an entire layout, this component can only be [previewed on a separate page](/admin).

  Typically you'll use this together with:

  - the [layout header component](/component-guide/layout_header)
  - the [layout footer component](/component-guide/layout_footer)

          include your styles

            <%= stylesheet_link_tag "application" %>
          <% end %>
        -->

        <!-- You probably want to use the header, main & footer components here -->

        <!--
          include your script e.g.
          <%= javascript_link_tag "application" %>
        -->
