description: A layout to be used by admin applications
body: |
  Typically you'll use this together with the
  [layout header component](/component-guide/layout_header) and the
  [layout footer component](/component-guide/layout_footer).

  Because it is an entire HTML document, this component can only be [previewed on a separate page](/admin).

display_preview: false
display_html: true
accessibility_criteria: |
  The layout template must:

    * have a `lang` attribute
    * contain a [skip link](/component-guide/skip_link)
    * have a sensible page `<title>`
examples:
  default:
    data:
      environment: production
      product_name: Publishing
      browser_title: 'A page title'
      block: |
        <!-- You probably want to use the header, main & footer components here -->
  with_custom_js_filename:
    description: An alternative JS filename can be used in place of the default `application.js` if required (note that this cannot easily be demonstrated here).
    data:
      environment: production
      product_name: Publishing
      browser_title: 'A page title'
      js_filename: "application"
      block: |
        <!-- You probably want to use the header, main & footer components here -->
  with_custom_css_filename:
    description: An alternative JS filename can be used in place of the default `application.scss` if required (note that this cannot easily be demonstrated here).
    data:
      environment: production
      product_name: Publishing
      browser_title: 'A page title'
      css_filename: "application"
      block: |
        <!-- You probably want to use the header, main & footer components here -->
