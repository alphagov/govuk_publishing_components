name: Admin layout
description: A layout to be used by admin applications
body: |
  Typically you'll use this together with the
  [layout header component](/component-guide/layout_header) and the
  [layout footer component](/component-guide/layout_footer).

  Because it is an entire HTML document, this component can only be [previewed on a separate page](/admin).

display_preview: false
display_html: true
accessibility_criteria: |
  The layout template must:

    * have a `lang` attribute
    * contain a [skip link](/component-guide/skip_link)
    * have a sensible page `<title>`

  default:
    data:
      environment: production

      block: |
        <!-- You probably want to use the header, main & footer components here -->
