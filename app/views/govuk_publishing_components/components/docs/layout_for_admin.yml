name: Admin layout (experimental)
description: A layout to be used by admin applications
body: |
  This component uses [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend),
  part of the GOV.UK Design System.

  It also includes the styles for the other components in this gem, so that you can use
  these components as well.

  This component is experimental. Breaking changes are likely and we'll not release
  major version of the gem for these changes.

  Because it is an entire layout, this component can only be [previewed on a separate page](/admin).

  Typically you'll use this together with a footer and header.

display_preview: false
display_html: true

  TBD
examples:
  default:
    data:
      browser_title: 'A page title'
      block: |
        <!-- You probably want to use the header, main & footer components here -->
