name: Grid list
description: The grid list component can be used to display a grid of content items.
body: |
  The markup for this component makes use of the unordered list `columns` attribute. This allows it to be ingested like a typical list by screen readers but allowing sighted users to see an organised column layout.

  The `title` attribute is rendered as a visually hidden h2 that will be communicated to screen reader users. This is a required attribute for this component, as without it screen reader users will have no context for the grid list.

  The original intent of this component was to account for the topics collections on the homepages of both [GOV.UK](https://gov.uk) and [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk).
accessibility_criteria: |
  The grid list component must:
  
    - include clear identification of what the intent of the grid list is eg: a heading
    - state how many items are in the list
  
  The items in a grid list must:

    - include appropriate text spacing, as per the guidance in [WCAG 1.4.12](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#text-spacing)
    - be navigable via screen readers, either via typical screen reader navigation or via screen reader heading navigation

  Links within items in a grid list must:

    - accept focus
    - be focusable with a keyboard
    - be usable with a keyboard
    - indicate when they have focus
    - change in appearance when touched (in the touch-down state)
    - change in appearance when hovered
    - be usable with touch
    - be usable with voice commands
    - have visible text
    - have meaningful text

  example_of_managed_columns:
    description: The browser will always try to display list items in a column lists in such a way that each column contains as close to the same number of items as possible. In the below example, the number of items provided is such that the browser will only use 2 columns instead of 1.
    data:
      title: "List of topics"
      items:
        - heading: "Business and economy"
          text: "Small businesses, industry, imports, exports and trade"
          href: "#business-and-economy"
        - heading: "Crime and justice"
          text: "Courts, police, prison, offenders, borders and immigration"
          href: "#crime-and-justice"
        - heading: "Defence"
          text: "Armed forces, health and safety, search and rescue"
          href: "#defence"
        - heading: "Education"
          text: "Students, training, qualifications and the National Curriculum"
          href: "#education"
  without_hrefs:
    description: |
      Headings for items will default to plain text headings if a href isn't provided.
      
      Please be conscious of how users may perceive an example like the one below, where items change between having link headings and not, as it's very likely that the change in expected behaviour may be confusing. This is especially true for screen reader users who may be navigating the page via links.
    data:
      title: "List of topics"
      items:
        - heading: "Business and economy"
          text: "Small businesses, industry, imports, exports and trade"
          href: "#business-and-economy"
        - heading: "Crime and justice"
          text: "Courts, police, prison, offenders, borders and immigration"
        - heading: "Defence"
          text: "Armed forces, health and safety, search and rescue"
        - heading: "Education"
          text: "Students, training, qualifications and the National Curriculum"

        - heading: "Environment"
