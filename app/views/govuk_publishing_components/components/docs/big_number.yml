name: Big number
description: A big number, with a label if needed, for visualising quantitative values such as the number of government departments or historical prime ministers.
body: |
  This component requires at least a non-falsey `number` attribute value passed to it, otherwise it will not render.
accessibility_criteria: |
  This component must:

  - communicate number value and label (if present) in a single dictation when read with a screen reader
  - convey the meaning of the number shown
shared_accessibility_criteria:
- link
examples:
  default:
    data:
      number: 119
  with_labels:
    description: Labels for numbers are given inline styling but stacked using pseudo elements with display block. This is to bypass an issue with NVDA where block level elements are dictated separately.
    data:
      number: 119
      label: Open consultations
  passing_extra_symbols:
    description: "In some cases, we want to communicate more than just the flat numeric value eg: `400+`, `90%`, `-20`, `1M` etc. This is why we allow values to be passed as flat strings."
    data:
      number: "400+"
      label: Other agencies and public bodies
  with_link:
    data:
      number: 23
      label: Ministerial departments
      href: "/government/organisations#ministerial_departments"
  with_link_but_no_label:
    description: Numbers that are links are underlined unless a label is provided, in which case the label is given the underline.
    data:
      number: 23
      href: "/government/organisations#ministerial_departments"
  with_data_attributes:
    description: |
      If a `href` attribute is present, `data_attributes` will apply to the `span` containing the number value (see below).

      Note that the component does not include built in tracking. If this is required consider using the [GA4 link tracker](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_publishing_components/blob/main/docs/analytics-ga4/trackers/ga4-link-tracker.md).
    data:
      number: 23
      label: Ministerial departments
      href: "/government/organisations#ministerial_departments"
      data_attributes:
        department-count: true
  with_data_attributes_but_no_link:
    data:
      number: 23
      label: Ministerial departments
      data_attributes:
        department-count: true
  with_aria_attributes:
    description: Aria attributes are applied to the whole component instance
    data:
      number: 23
      label: Ministerial departments
      aria:
        hidden: true
  with_bottom_margin:
    description: The component accepts a number for margin bottom from `0` to `9` (`0px` to `60px`) using the [GOV.UK Frontend spacing scale](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/spacing/#the-responsive-spacing-scale). The default big number margin bottom is `15px` (`govuk-spacing(3)`).
    data:
      number: 119
      label: Open consultations
      margin_bottom: 9
