name: Cookie banner
description: Help users manage their personal data by telling them when you store cookies on their device.
body: |
  By default the cookie banner is hidden. If JavaScript is enabled, the banner is displayed if cookie preferences are not set. The banner will stay hidden if cookie preferences are already set.

  Setting `data-hide-cookie-banner="true"` on any link inside the banner will overwrite the default action and when clicked will dismiss the cookie banner for a period of 365 days (approx. 1 year).

  If the examples below are not showing the banner, make sure JS is enabled, and the `cookies_preferences_set` cookie is not present or is set to false.
