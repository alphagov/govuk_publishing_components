name: Image card
description: Image and associated text with a link
body: |
  An image and links, meant for use for news articles and people. Includes optional paragraph and additional links.

  The component is generally to be used within a grid column but has no grid of its own, so the text and the images in the examples below may not always line up. This will normally look tidier, for example [on pages like this](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/attorney-generals-office).

  Images should have an aspect ratio of 3:2.
accessibility_criteria: |
  The component must:

  - include alt text for images when present
  - not have duplicate links for the image and the text
  - if the contents of the component are in a different language than the rest of the document, include an appropriate `lang` attribute to correctly identify the language used in the component

      `srcset` is another responsive images attribute (see `sizes` section above for info on how responsive images work).

      `srcset` strings typically pull from the `asset/images` directory of a repo so use this as a starting point when writing paths for your `srcset` image keys.

      Note that the below example will appear to render incorrectly as we don't want to include `srcset` example images in our component guide as this will get served to frontend apps, adding weight to the user to download.
