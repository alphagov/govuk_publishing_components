name: Image card
description: Image and associated text with a link
body: |
  An image and links, meant for use for news articles and people. Includes optional paragraph and additional links.

  The component is generally to be used within a grid column but has no grid of its own, so the text and the images in the examples below may not always line up. This will normally look tidier, for example [on pages like this](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/attorney-generals-office).
accessibility_criteria: |
  The component must:

  - include alt text for images when present
  - not have duplicate links for the image and the text
  - if the contents of the component are in a different language than the rest of the document, include an appropriate `lang` attribute to correctly identify the language used in the component

      image_alt: "some meaningful alt text please"
      heading_text: "News headline"
  with_a_different_heading_level:
    description: Use a different heading level for the main link title. Defaults to H2 if not passed.
    data:

      heading_text: "I am not a heading"
      heading_level: 0
  with_different_link_size:
    description: |
      Set a different font size for the link. Uses the [GOV.UK Frontend heading sizes](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/#headings) but defaults to 19px for legacy reasons. Valid options are `xl`, `l`, `m` and `s`.

      This option is not tied to the `heading_level` option in order to give flexibility.

  without_heading_text:
    description: |
      The only required parameter to the component is href but if no heading_text is supplied the link will not appear. This is to allow the component to use only extra links as shown.

      In this situation the link could have been applied to the image but having a link on the image like this without text can be confusing.
