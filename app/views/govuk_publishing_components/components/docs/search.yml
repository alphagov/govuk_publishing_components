name: "Search"
description: "Search box"
body: |
  A search box with label and attached submit button. The component must be used within an HTML form.
  The search input has a name="q" attribute and a customisable ID and NAME.

  It can be used on white or on govuk-blue using the `on_govuk_blue` option.

  Markup such as heading tags can be included in the label using the label_text option. Styling is not included in the component for heading tags in labels, however this is what the search results page does.
accessibility_criteria: |
  The search box should:

  - be used inside a form with the role of 'search', to indicate it as a [search landmark](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#aria_lh_search)
  - have a clear label to identify the search functionality, which is visible to all users

  with_aria_controls_attribute:
    description: |
      The aria-controls attribute is a 'relationship attribute' which denotes which elements in a page an interactive element or set of elements has control over and affects.

      For places like the finders where the page is updated dynamically after value changes to the input.
    data:
      aria_controls: "wrapper"
  with_custom_button_text:
    description: |
      The search box component may be used multiple times on a page -- for example, on a [guidance and regulation finder results page](https://www.gov.uk/search/guidance-and-regulation?keywords=bananas&order=relevance) there is both the sitewide search in the header and also for the specific finder.

      To avoid confusion, the text inside the button should be different for each form. This can be done by setting the `button_text` parameter.

      This is visually hidden text -- to check for changes use a screen reader or inspect the button element.
    data:
      button_text: "Search absolutely everywhere"
  with_set_label_size:
    description: |
      Allows the label text size to be set to `xl`, `l`, `m`, or `s`. If this is set, then `inline_label` is automatically set to `false`.
    data:
      label_size: "xl"
  wrap_label_inside_a_heading:
    description: |
      Puts the label inside a heading; heading level defaults to `2` if not set.

      (The size of the label can still be set with `label_size` to appear more like a heading.)
    data:
      wrap_label_in_a_heading: true
      heading_level: 1
  with_margin_bottom:
    description: |
      Allows the spacing at the bottom of the component to be adjusted.

      This accepts a number from `0` to `9` (`0px` to `60px`) using the [GOV.UK Frontend spacing scale](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/spacing/#the-responsive-spacing-scale). It defaults to having no margin bottom.
    data:
      margin_bottom: 9
  with_margin_bottom_for_the_label:
    description: |
      Allows the spacing between the label and the input be adjusted.

      Requires `inline_label` to be false.

      This accepts a number from `0` to `9` (`0px` to `60px`) using the [GOV.UK Frontend spacing scale](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/spacing/#the-responsive-spacing-scale). It defaults to having no margin bottom.
    data:
      label_margin_bottom: 9
      inline_label: false
  with_custom_label_class:
    description: |
      Allows adding a custom class to the label of the component.
    data:
      label_custom_class: "govuk-heading-xl"
  with_corrections_disabled:
    description: |
      Allows disabling mobile browser autocorrect features (`autocorrect` and `autocapitalize`
      attributes) on the input field.

      Mobile browser autocorrect and text substitution features can conflict with the built in
      autocorrect features of some search engines, and will frequently correct domain-specific
      search terms to something that is not what the user intended (for example, correcting "SORN"
      to "sworn" or "HMRC" to "Hercules"). Capitalisation can also be significant for some search
      engines such as that currently used by Search API v2.
    data:
      disable_corrections: true
