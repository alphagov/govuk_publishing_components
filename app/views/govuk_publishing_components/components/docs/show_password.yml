name: Show password input (experimental)
description: A password input field that allows the password to be shown.
body: |
  Adds a password reveal button to an input that toggles its type from password to text, revealing the password. Does not appear if JavaScript is disabled.

  Uses a visually hidden bit of text to inform screen reader users of the state of the input rather than announcing the content of the password input when toggled.

  This component is currently experimental. If you are using it, please feed back any research findings to the Accounts team.

examples:
  default:
    data:
      label:
        text: Please enter your password
      value: this is my password
  disable_form_submit_check:
    description: The component sets the `autocomplete` attribute on the input to "off" so that browsers don't remember the password. This isn't reliable, so the component reverts the input type back to a password when its parent form is submitted. If this is causing conflicts with other JavaScript on your form, you can set `disable-form-submit-check` to `true` to disable this functionality and implement it yourself.
    data:
      label:
        text: Please enter your password
      value: this is my password
      disable_form_submit_check: true
  set_autocomplete_attribute:
    description: By default, autocomplete is set to `off`. This can be set to `new-password` or `current-password` to help browsers differentiate between new and current passwords.
    data:
      label:
        text: Please enter your password
      autocomplete: "current-password"
      value: this is my password

  with_data_attributes:
    description: Data attributes can be passed to add to the input element. If the data attribute starts with `data-button-` this attribute will be applied to the show/hide button, instead of the input. Note that if JS is disabled, all attributes are added to the input.
    data:

        text: Your password
