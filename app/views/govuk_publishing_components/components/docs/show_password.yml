name: Show password input
description: A password input field that allows the password to be shown.
body: |
  Adds a password reveal button to an input that toggles its type from password to text, revealing the password. Does not appear if JavaScript is disabled.

  Uses a visually hidden bit of text to inform screen reader users of the state of the input rather than announcing the content of the password input when toggled.

examples:
  default:
    data:
      label:
        text: Please enter your password
      value: this is my password
  disable_form_submit_check:
    description: The component sets the `autocomplete` attribute on the input to "off" so that browsers don't remember the password. This isn't reliable, so the component reverts the input type back to a password when its parent form is submitted. If this is causing conflicts with other JavaScript on your form, you can set `disable-form-submit-check` to `true` to disable this functionality and implement it yourself.

      label:
        text: Please enter your password
      value: this is my password
