  with_dir_attribute:

      Allows the correct display of right to left languages.

      By default the textarea element and the label both display text in a left to right direction.

      When the `right_to_left` parameter of the textarea component is set to `true` both the textarea and the label display their content in a right to left direction. 

      The direction of the text in the label element can be overridden by setting the `right_to_left` parameter of the label to `false`.

      If hint text is included this will display in the same direction as the label.
    data:
      label:
        text: "Some textarea text to be displayed right to left with a label displayed left to right"
        right_to_left: false
      hint: "Some hint text that displays in the same text direction as the label"
