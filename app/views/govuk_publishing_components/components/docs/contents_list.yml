name: Contents list
description: Provides a list of links with options for dashes or numbering.
body: |
  Commonly used to lists a page’s contents with links pointing to headings within the document, but can also be used for a list of links to other pages.

  Pass a list of contents each with an `href` and `text`. The `href` can point at the ID of a heading within the page.

  Supports nesting contents one level deep, currently only used by specialist documents. When nesting the top level list items
  display in bold.

  `format_numbers` option will pull out numbers in the link text to render them as though they were the list style type. Applies to numbers at the start of text, with or without a decimal. See the [format complex numbers fixture](/component-guide/contents-list/formats_complex_numbers) for details.
accessibility_criteria: |
  The component must be [a landmark with a navigation role](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/27/using-navigation-landmarks/).

  The contents list must:

  - inform the user how many items are in the list
  - convey the content structure
  - indicate the current page when contents span different pages, and not link to itself
  - include an aria-label to contextualise the list
  - ensure dashes before each list item are hidden from screen readers

  Links with formatted numbers must separate the number and text with a space for correct screen reader pronunciation. This changes pronunciation from "1 dot Item" to "1 Item".

    description: By default we do not underline links in this component even though this is the general approach on GOV.UK.
