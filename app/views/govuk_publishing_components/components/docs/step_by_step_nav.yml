name: Step by step navigation
description: A series of expanding/collapsing steps designed to navigate a user through a process
body: |
  Step by step navigations show a sequence of steps towards a specific goal, such as 'learning to drive'. Each step can contain one or more links to pages. User research suggested that each step should be collapsed by default so that users are not overwhelmed with information.

  If JavaScript is disabled the step by step navigation expands fully. All of the functionality (including the icons and aria attributes) are added using JavaScript.

  This component is based on the accordion component in collections, but has been altered. This is for two reasons.

  - step by step navigations are needed throughout GOV.UK and extending the accordion to be this component would require it to be moved out of that application, which would break integration testing
  - creating a new component allows further iteration without impacting the accordion

  Background information relating to the testing and research behind this component can be found on the [Modelling Services wiki](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MS/pages) in Q2 to Q4, 2017/18.
accessibility_criteria: |
  The step by step navigation must:

  - indicate to users that each step can be expanded and collapsed
  - inform the user when a step has been expanded or collapsed
  - be usable with a keyboard
  - allow users to show or hide all steps at once
  - inform the user which step a link belongs to
  - inform the user which step the current page is in
  - be readable when only the text of the page is zoomed - achieved for the numbers and logic elements by their text being wrapped in several elements that give them a white background and ensure the text when zoomed expands to the left, not to the right, where it would obscure the step titles

  The show/hide all button only needs to list the first panel `id` in the `aria-controls` attribute, rather than all of them.

  Step headings must use a button element:

  - so that steps can be toggled with the space and enter keys
  - so that steps can't be opened in a new tab or window

  When JavaScript is unavailable the component must:

  - be fully expanded
  - not be marked as expandable

      Links within steps are tracked with the [ga4-link-tracker](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_publishing_components/blob/main/docs/analytics-ga4/ga4-link-tracker.md). Links are given a data attribute of `ga4-link`, which contains the relevant tracking data as JSON.

      - `active`, whether to make the link highlighted (to indicate the current page)
      - `highlight_step`, a general option to highlight the step. Usually the active link would be in the active step, but in some circumstances there might be an active step but no highlighted link.

  solve_the_double_dot_problem:
    description: |
      As shown, options can be passed to the component to highlight one step, expand one step by default, and highlight multiple links. These options should only be used when the component is in the sidebar. The step that is highlighted and expanded will be referred to as the active step (even though they are separate options, it is assumed that they will normally be applied to the same step).

      If a link is in a step by step navigation more than once and the user is on that page, the backend doesn't know which link to highlight, so it highlights both of them.

      JavaScript is included in the component to solve this. It uses `sessionStorage` to capture the data-position attribute of non-external links when clicked, and then uses this value to decide which link to highlight after the new page loads. It uses the value of the `tracking_id` option to uniquely identify the current step nav in the session (if this is not passed to the component this may result in other step navs having the wrong link highlighted).

      If a user has not clicked a link (i.e. has visited the page without first clicking on a step by step navigation) only the first duplicate link will be highlighted. If that link is not in the active step, the JavaScript makes the highlighted link's parent the active step. If there is no active step, the first active link will be highlighted (but there should always be an active step).

      The example below will show all non-external links highlighted if JavaScript is disabled. In the real world no more than two or three links are likely to be highlighted at once.

      Changes to the active step and highlighted link are also applied on click, if the user clicks one of the other links that is to the same page (they are amended by the component to be jump links to the top of the page). Open this example using the 'preview' link and try clicking on the 'internal' links to see how it behaves.

  tracking_the_user_journey_through_the_query_string:
    description: |
      When the step by step pattern was first introduced, one of the problems we noticed was that if a content page is in more than one step by step journey, it wasn't practical to expand all of the step by steps, as the sidebar became very long.

      We solved this problem in a few ways:

      1. Only show a list of titles for the step by steps that the content page is part of.
      2. Only display this list if the content item is part of fewer than 5 step by step journeys
      3. Allow content designers to optionally hide a step by step journey on content pages.

      The consequence of this is that if users land on any of these pages, they lose sight of the journey they are on, and which step of the journey they have reached (the black dot).

      The solution is to track the step by step journey the user is on.

      This has been achieved by adding a query string to all of the internal links in the step by step that contains the `content_id` of the step by step.

      For example, if the step by step contains a link to [/check-uk-visa](/check-uk-visa), the component will render the link as [/check-uk-visa?step-by-step-nav=d8f3c2e0-d544-4664-9616-ab71323e4d18](/check-uk-visa?step-by-step-nav=d8f3c2e0-d544-4664-9616-ab71323e4d18)

      As long as the user follows the links in the step by step (and not the inline links in the content), the component will know which step by step journey the user is on.

      If the content item is part of multiple step by steps, the component fetches the `content_id` of the `active` step by step from the query string and expands that one. The other step by steps that the content item is part of are displayed as a list of titles under an "Also part of" heading.

      Additionally, if content designers have chosen to "hide" a step by step on a content page, but we can see that the user is following a step by step journey (the `content_id` of the step by step is in the querystring), the step by step will still be displayed and expanded in the sidebar, and the other step by steps that the content item is part of, but content designers have chosen to hide will also be displayed as a list of titles under an "Also part of heading".

      In both cases, we never show more than 5 step by steps in the list.

      If the user lands on the content page "cold", i.e. from Google, and not from the step by step sidebar (or overview page), the original rules for the displaying the step by step sidebar will apply.

      The rules are as follows:

      1. Content item is part of one step by step

          Expand the step by step in the sidebar

      2. Content item is part of multiple step by steps

          Show a list of step by steps under the "Part of" heading

      3. Step by step is marked as "hidden" for the content page

          Do not display the step by step

      Changes to the rules when the user is on a step by step journey (the query string is in the url):

      1. Content item is part of one step by step

          No change, expand the step by step in the sidebar

      2. Content item is part of multiple step by steps

          Expand the step by step in the querystring

          Show a list of the other step by steps under an "Also part of" heading, if the content item is part of less than 5 step by step journeys

      3. Step by step is marked as "hidden" for the content page

          Expand the step by step in the querystring

          Show a list of the other step by steps (including other step by steps that have been marked as "hidden") under an "Also part of" heading, if the content item is part of less than 5 step by step journeys

      Changes to the rules when there is a secondary step by step linked:

      1. Content item is part of one step by step

          No change. Expand the step by step in the sidebar.

      2. Content item is part of multiple step by steps and no secondary step by step

          No change. Will show a list of primary step by steps under the "Part of" heading. Secondary step by steps will not be shown.

      3. User is on a step by step journey (the query string is in the url)

          No change. Active step by step will be expanded.

      4. Content item is part of multiple primary step by steps and a single secondary step by step

          No change. Show "Part of" step by steps list. Secondary step by step won't be shown.

      5. Content item is part of multiple step by steps and multiple secondary step by steps

          No change. Show "Part of" step by step list. Secondary step by step won't be shown.

      6. Step by step is marked as "hidden" for the content page

          No change. "Also part of" component will only show when an active step by step is shown.

      7. Content item is part of one secondary step by step and no other step by steps are linked.

          Show secondary step by step expanded.

      8. Content item is part of multiple secondary step by steps and no other step by steps are linked.

          Show secondary step by step list in "Part of" component.

      - Optional steps used to have a dotted line down the side but this was removed as it confused users
      - Logic will change the number next to a step to the word 'and' or the word 'or'
