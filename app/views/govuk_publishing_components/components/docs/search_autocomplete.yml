name: Search Autocomplete (experimental)
description: The autocomplete component lets users select from a dynamic list of suggestions to populate the value of a search input element.
body: |
  This component does not perform any matching of user input to refine suggestions. The assumption is that the backend returns only results that match the query string.
  This component is currently experimental because more research is needed to validate it pending autocomplete implementation documented in the [GDS roadmap](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/upcoming-components-patterns/).

  ### source (required configuration option)
  Url to request suggestion data from. A query parameter of q={inputValue} will be appended to this url.

  Supplying source as a hardcoded array exists for the purposes of demonstration and testing where an actual HTTP endpoint is not ideal.
